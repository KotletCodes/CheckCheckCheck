This is a Short ( and incomplete) logical rendition of what my take on a check checker for a chess game would look like. It works for only two peices ( bishop and rook)'
But these two peices prove that I would be able to code all other peices ( except for Knight as of yet) as they all share the same movement. 
( a Queen is basically just a bishop and a rook merged together).
